Introduction
------------

The Formulations and Computational Engineering (FORCE) project, implemented within the EU Horizon
2020 program (https://www.the-force-project.eu), aims to bring materials modelling to the heart of
business decision making via creation of Business Decision Support Systems (BDSS).
By doing so, industries will be able to make more knowledgeable decisions based not only on existing
legacy data, but also on new data generated by state of the art multi-scale and multi-physics materials
modelling.

This software provides an integrated framework that connects simulation
models of varying complexity, experimental data sets and commercially relevant information
(material / production costs) together as a ``Workflow`` pipeline construct. Consequently, users are
able to select from a wide variety of parameters and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used
to identify the optimal trade off when making a business decisions. An integrated set of multi-criteria
optimization (MCO) algorithms will then identify optimal outcomes to consider, typically by mapping out a
Pareto frontier.

Development of the FORCE BDSS and Workflow Manager has been closely aligned to activities of the European
Materials Modelling Council (EMMC) which promotes the establishment of materials modelling ontologies and
standards/metadata as avenues for interoperability between models, optimisation platforms,
and business decision frameworks.

FORCE BDSS
~~~~~~~~~~

The FORCE BDSS is the CLI support for the evaluation of Pareto front computations. It is a single executable
``force_bdss`` that interprets a workflow specification file, normally generated via the GUI
workflow manager.

By itself, the executable and the code implementing it provides no
functionality. All functionality comes from external plugins, extending the
API to provide new entities, specifically:

- Multi Criteria Optimizer (MCO)
- DataSources, which can be a simulator or just a database
- Notification Listeners, like a remote database which retrieve data during the
  computation
- UI Hooks, which permit to define additional operations which will be executed
  at specific moments in the UI lifetime (before and after execution of the
  BDSS, before saving the workflow)

Plugin support requires compliance to the Force BDSS api for plugins.
Extensions are registered via setuptools entry points.

Execution of the force bdss executable is simple. Invoke with::

    force_bdss workflow.json

FORCE Workflow Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FORCE Workflow Manager is a GUI that can aid the creation of workflows, submit BDSS jobs
and view the results of an MCO. It is invoked by calling ``force-wfmanager`` in the command
line. The UI is responsible for creating the ``workflow.json`` file that
is then submitted for execution by the ``force_bdss`` CLI.

Installation instructions for both the FORCE BDSS and Workflow Manager are provided in
the next topic.
