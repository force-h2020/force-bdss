Installation Instructions
-------------------------
To install force-bdss and the workflow manager, first checkout the following
git repositories::

    git clone https://github.com/force-h2020/force-bdss
    git clone https://github.com/force-h2020/force-wfmanager
    git clone https://github.com/force-h2020/force-bdss-plugin-enthought-example

The last repository is optional, but recommended if you want to practice
writing plugins.

If you never installed the Enthought Deployment Manager, perform the following operations::

    wget https://package-data.enthought.com/edm/rh5_x86_64/1.11/edm_1.11.0_linux_x86_64.sh && bash ./edm_1.11.0_linux_x86_64.sh-b -f -p $HOME
    export PATH=${HOME}/edm/bin:${PATH}
    edm install --version 3.6 -y click setuptools
    edm shell

If you instead already have an EDM installation and a default environment, perform the following::

    edm shell
    edm install -y click setuptools

Verify that your shell prompt now contains the string "(edm)".
You are now in your default EDM environment, and we assume this environment to be the bootstrap environment.
The BDSS software will not be installed in this environment, but in a separate one. The following
commands however must be executed from the bootstrap environment.

Installation of the force BDSS runtime environment is performed with the
following command. This should be done from the directory containing the ``force-bdss`` folder (named
``Force-Project`` in this example)::

    ~/Force-Project (edm)$ cd force-bdss
    ~/Force-Project/force-bdss (edm)$ python -m ci build-env

This will create another edm environment called ``force-py36``.
Do not enter this environment. 

To install the BDSS::

    ~/Force-Project/force-bdss (edm)$ python -m ci install
    ~/Force-Project/force-bdss (edm)$ cd ..
    
To install the workflow manager::

    ~/Force-Project (edm)$ cd force-wfmanager
    ~/Force-Project/force-wfmanager (edm)$ python -m ci install
    ~/Force-Project/force-wfmanager (edm)$ cd ..

and (optional, but recommended), the example plugins::

    ~/Force-Project (edm)$ cd force-bdss-plugin-enthought-example
    ~/Force-Project/force-bdss-plugin-enthought-example (edm)$ python -m ci install
    ~/Force-Project/force-bdss-plugin-enthought-example (edm)$ cd ..

Now you can enter the deployed environment and invoke the programs::

    ~/Force-Project (edm)$ edm shell -e force-py36
    # Invokes the CLI BDSS evaluator (requires a workflow file)
    ~/Force-Project (force-py36)$ force_bdss workflow.json
    # Invokes the workflow manager UI - an optional workflow file can also be specified 
    ~/Force-Project (force-py36)$ force_wfmanager
    ~/Force-Project (force-py36)$ force_wfmanager workflow.json
    
The programs can also be launched with an ``edm run`` command::
    
    ~/Anywhere $ edm run -e force-py36 -- force_wfmanager
